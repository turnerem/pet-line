TODO, ordered by nextness
- put line on rect. Make rect move and add filter to it. Flip slop of line
  when direction changes
- add buttons to increase/decreasae hunger, energy, etc. For testing.
- think of mood updater given owner action. This could be a switch on owner
  action. This is probably preferable: having all owner-influenced mood
  updating in just one function
  - ditto for mood updating given want X

how to manage the coordinates of the line? Coordinates are needed to
initialise line loc. Then x is updated based on movement. Need a custom hook
for managing movement (x)?

Some variables are required everywhere: svgDims, pet characteristics, pet loc,
foodbowl loc, foodbowl dims
